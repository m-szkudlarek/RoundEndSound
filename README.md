- `!res_debug_last / css_res_debug_last` | Replays last track for diagnostics

## How add music to server
In few:
1. Create addon with your songs and post him in workshop
   **[Example SoundEvents addon file](https://github.com/webpashtet/RoundEndSound/blob/main/workshop/soundevents_addon.vsndevts)**
2. Add the addon to the server using [**MultiAddonManager**](https://github.com/Source2ZE/MultiAddonManager)
3. Configure the **Round End Sound** config
```json
"music_list": [
  {
    "name": "Test track 1",
    "path": "sounds/music/res_1.vsnd_c"
  },
  {
    "name": "Test track 2",
    "path": "sounds/music/res_2.vsnd_c"
  }
]
```

## Sound files verification checklist
Use this quick process when HUD/chat says a song is playing but no audio is heard:

1. **Copy the exact path from server logs**
   - Example from logs: `play sounds/my_sound_pack/gdzie.vsnd_c`

2. **Check that this exact path exists inside your workshop addon/VPK**
   - Path must match exactly (folder names and letter case).
   - Linux servers are case-sensitive.

3. **Verify config paths**
   - Every `music_list[].path` must point to a `.vsnd_c` file that exists in the mounted addon.

4. **Verify addon is mounted on the server**
   - Ensure MultiAddonManager mounted your workshop addon and search path points to your addon VPK.

5. **Verify client can receive/use the resource**
   - Join with a real player (not only bots) and test after one full round end.

6. **Cross-check plugin diagnostics**
   - If you see `PlaySound: executing 'play ...'` but still no sound, issue is usually missing/wrong resource path in addon.
